catalog_subset_description: # 2011 only
catalog_subset: chapter_tag_cat <- subset( chapter_tag_cat , year == 2011 )

~~~{dataset_introduction}
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) tracks the reading competency of fourth graders across about fifty nations.
~~~

table_structure: * A series of tables with one record per school (ACG), per student (ASG), per teacher (ATG), as well as files containing student achievement (ASA), home background (ASH), student-teacher linkage (AST), and within-country scoring reliability (ASR).

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to the fourth-grade student population of participating countries.

publication_period: * Released quinquennially since 2001.

administrative_organization: * Funded by the [International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement](https://www.iea.nl/) and compiled by the [Lynch School of Education at Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/lsoe.html).
